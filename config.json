There are many 20th-century defensive structures dotted around the countryside and coast of Northern Ireland. These include training trenches, gun and searchlight emplacements, pillboxes, observation posts, airfields, harbours, naval and flying boat bases, air raid shelters, and many other related structures. The majority of these are derelict, some have been reused or altered, and others are in a state of decay or have been demolished.","organizationName":"National Sports Museum","organizationCityAndState":"Melbourne","organizationWebsite":"http://www.nsm.org.au/","contactUs":"Contact the GIS Unit, Queen's University Belfast, l.barry@qub.ac.uk","contactContent":"Defence Heritage NI http://go.qub.ac.uk/DefenceHeritageNI","videoIntroduction":"The Defence Heritage Project Features on Episode 2 of BBC NI's Home Ground Series, aired on 2nd May 2016. http://bbc.in/1VOPdb1","videoUrl":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b078m2d8/home-ground-episode-1","twitterSearchTerm":"","twitterWidgetId":"","facebookLinkLabel":"Living Legacies","facebookLink":"http://www.livinglegacies1914-18.ac.uk/","twitterLinkLabel":"View maps gallery","twitterLink":"https://go.qub.ac.uk/gismaps","blogLinkLabel":"Read our spatial blog","blogLink":"http://blogs.qub.ac.uk/gis/","websiteLinkLabel":"Visit our site","websiteLink":"http://www.qub.ac.uk/sites/GeographicalInformationScience/","primaryBackgroundColor":"FFF","secondaryBackgroundColor":"EEE","introSectionName":"","featuresSectionName":"Record information on sites in Northern Ireland with a defence history","aboutSectionName":"About","exploreSectionName":"Explore","connectSectionName":"Connect","isFeaturesSectionVisible":true,"isAboutSectionVisible":true,"isExploreSectionVisible":true,"isConnectSectionVisible":true,"itemId":"d6a1271d175b4c6bb6878b9504142723","screenshots":["images/screenshots/belfast1901_trans.jpg.jpg","images/screenshots/DHP_TITLE_2.jpg.jpg"]}
